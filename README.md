# 🩻 Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays

Hi there! Welcome to my AI project. 👋

This project uses **Artificial Intelligence (Deep Learning)** to look at Chest X-Ray images and figure out if a person has **Pneumonia** or is **Normal**. 

It’s like creating a smart assistant for doctors to help them catch diseases faster! 🏥⚡

### 📂 What's in this repository?

*   **`Medical_Image_Analysis.ipynb`**: This is the main "Brain" of the project. It contains all the code that trains the AI model, shows graphs, and tests the results. 🧠💻
*   **`chest_xray/`**: This folder contains the actual X-Ray images used to teach the AI. (Uploaded using Git Large File Storage because there are so many of them!) 📸

### 🚀 How it works

1.  We feed X-Ray images into the code.
2.  The AI learns patterns (like "cloudy" spots in lungs often mean Pneumonia).
3.  We test it to see how accurate it is!
